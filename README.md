# Hiett_RL
source.c is my attempts at taking the pdf of John's original Master's Thesis "Reinforcement Learning Experiments with State Classifiers for_Controlling an Inverted Pendulum" and possibly getting it working again on an old Windows 95 machine.
This code was successfully compiled using Borland's C Compiler and MS Windows graphics libraries in 1997. Considering this was done nearly 30 years ago John was clearly ahead of the curve and used RL to keep upright an inverted pendulum.  I find this a 
fascinating endevor and am trying to find the "Neurons" in the cpp code; trying to take the abstract notions and turn them into concrete concepts for "regular" people to understand. 

There are now a ton of videos regarding inverted pendulums even several with double pendulums being balanced successfully and gracefully.
